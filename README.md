# The Santinian Dictionary of Modern Language

Have you ever wondered how the current generation of our society (i.e., Generation Alpha) talks?

Is it safe for kids or is it something [NSFW](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSFW)?
The SDML's beautiful and minimal [web interface](https://sdml-en.onrender.com) comes to the rescue!

Just type your query and press ENTER. In seconds, the SDML will return a list of definitions, complete with IPA syntax
and even the origins and contexts for certain words!
