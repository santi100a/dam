# The Santinian Dictionary of Modern Language

Have you ever wondered how the current generation of our society (i.e., Generation Alpha) talks?
What do words like "rizz" and "sigma" really mean? Where do they even come from?
Is it safe for kids or is it something [NSFW](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSFW)?
You can find out with my humble little dictionary!

Are you an old-school person who only uses `curl` to look up stuff in an online dictionary?
Well, you can do that as well for kid slang with the SDML!

```bash
$ curl "dict://sdml-en.onrender.com:80/d:cringe"

220 - SDML "The Santinian Dictionary of Modern Language" v1.0
Send word suggestions to [hyper.industries+sdml@protonmail.com]
250 - OK
150 - Found 2 definition(s) for "rizz":
1. rizz (n.) /ɹˈɪz/
   ...
```

Or are you a more casual, practical user who just wants a simple dictionary to understand their little cousin?
The SDML's beautiful and minimal [web interface](https://sdml-en.onrender.com) comes to the rescue!

We have a beautiful interface and a minimal DICT API, but we might not have ALL words, and some of them might have
some tweaks to make the DICT stuff go well (e.g. "fanum-tax" instead of "fanum tax", so don't fret if you don't
find it at first). If you can't find a word you'd like, you can e-mail my team at <hyper.industries+sdml@protonmail.com>
and we will do our best to get back in touch with you ASAP.
